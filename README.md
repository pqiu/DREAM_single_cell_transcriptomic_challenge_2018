# DREAM_single_cell_transcriptomic_challenge_2018

Raw data provided by the challenge were downloaded and saved in the "download" folder.

script "submit_step_01_read_prep_data.m" takes the raw data in the download folder and stores the data in Matlab file format ("raw_data.mat").

script "submit_step_02_SPD_graph_approach.m" performs the analysis described in the wiki. Running this script will produce the files in "results_graph", which are what we submitted for the three subchallenges.
